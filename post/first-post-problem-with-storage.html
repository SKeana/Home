        <h2>How I Forgot about My Storage</h2>
        <p>
            I am someone that usese my computer everyday, this is for games, learning and coding, knowing this it easy to know that storage is very importet as if you 
            have no storage left then you are going to have problems, this is the problem I came to a couple of week ago.</n>
            When this happen I was trying to make this website that you are on now, problem I was getting an error that I've never seen before, that not something new 
            for me, so I when on ChatGPT and copy and past the error to see what I need to fix it, this is when I thought I was going made. What happen was that when I ran
            "npm run dev" I would get an error that came down to me not having "dev" as a dependence, so I try adding it as a dependence to fix the problem but no there 
            was still an error, so then I thought It code be my node veirsion that I am running so I uninstall node to redownload it but this was when the biggest problem
            with my storage happen, my computer wouldn't download it, at first I thought it wouldn't download on my C drive but I then thought it was orgially on a different
            drive but then the problem kept on coming as now no download of any type was working.</n>
