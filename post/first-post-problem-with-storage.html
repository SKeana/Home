        <p class="post-meta">Published on <time datetime="2025-01-11">June 11, 2025</time> by Shuan Kean</p>
        <h2>How I Forgot about My Storage</h2>
        <p>
            I am someone that usese my computer everyday, this is for games, learning and coding, knowing this it easy to know that storage is very importet as if you 
            have no storage left then you are going to have problems, this is the problem I came to a couple of week ago.</n>
            When this happen I was trying to make this website that you are on now, problem I was getting an error that I've never seen before, that not something new 
            for me, so I when on ChatGPT and copy and past the error to see what I need to fix it, this is when I thought I was going mad. What happen was that when I ran
            "npm run dev" I would get an error that came down to me not having "dev" as a dependence, so I try adding it as a dependence to fix the problem but no there 
            was still an error, so then I thought it could be my node veirsion that I am running so I uninstall node to redownload it but this was when the biggest problem
            with my storage happen, my computer wouldn't download it, at first I thought it wouldn't download on my C drive but I then thought it was orgially on a different
            drive but then the problem kept on coming as now no download of any type was working.</n>
            When I say nothing was working I mean NOTHING, Windows wasn't updating and now my browers wasn't working ether, so this small thing of trying to make a website was
            the thing that mostly kill my computer.
        </p>

        <h3>How did I fix this</h3>
        <p>
            This was a problem as my computer was something I use everyday I wanted to use it everyday but as it was basely unuseable I needed to fix it, the first thing I did 
            was try was factory resetting my computer but there wasn't enough space just for Windows on my C drive. </n>
            Now I didn't have a working Windows. So I thought about it and relise I needed to get a new Windows key and change the boot option so that I could have Windows on
            a different drive, but as I was buying a new Windows key I thought I might as well get a m.2 dive so when I start my computer and VScode it would be a bit faster.
            So that was that got it all sorted and now I look at how much storage I have on my C drive weekly as I don't want to go thought that again.
