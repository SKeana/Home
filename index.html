        <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio and Blog</h1>
        <h2>What am i doing on this website</h2>
        <p>The whole reason for this website is that I was watching Youtube and saw someone talking about why they made a personal website in 2025 and it was someone thatopend my 
            eye. Even though I can't fine the video now the person talk about them being move over or starting a new job working with NEXT JS and they didn't have expresens with it 
            so they made a website that they talk about when it comes to learning something new it almost always better to do to learn.</n>
            Also they talk about it was a fun way to make something you haven't seen and have it just how you like it, as the website is only going to be seen by people that know 
            me and hopefully future employer as well.
