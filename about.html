        <h1>Welcome to about me</h1>
        <h2>Why and how did I get into coding</h2>
        <p>
            When I started thinking about what I wanted to I really thought about all of the diffenent job and what make a job something that someone want to work at for yera 
            and really become great at it, for myself I've always look at people that make things and wish I could do the same.
            The first time trying to code anything was when i was playing World of Warcraft as there are addon that alow you to make small iconse that tell you this that is 
            happing but the is only a small amount of code you need to write in Lua and that was the first time trying to code as I wanted to get better at playing World of 
            Warcraft and Lua help me do that.
        </p>
        <h2>What are some of my passion out side of coding</h2>
        <p>
            Some of my passion is learning of any type that is why I made my blog as it would be a place for me to talk about some of the new things that I have learning, this
            can be from book that I read or project that I've done and working on.
